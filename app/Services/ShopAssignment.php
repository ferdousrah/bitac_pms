/**
 * Who in a shop may do what with a job — the one place that knows.
 *
 * BITAC's shops run নির্বাহী প্রকৌশলী over assistant engineers. A job arriving
 * at a shop is the XEN's until he hands it to an AE (or sends it straight to a
 * sub-section); the AE then receives it and does the work.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The XEN is whoever holds `assign shop-jobs` at that shop.** There is no
 * supervisor column to keep in step with people moving posts.
 *
 * ⚠️ **A shop with NO XEN behaves exactly as it always did** — `gateActive()`
 * is false and every rule here lets everyone through. That is deliberate: a
 * shop whose staff were never given the role must not wake up to an empty
 * queue, and in-flight jobs carry `assigned_to = null`. The same shape as an
 * empty quotation approval chain.
